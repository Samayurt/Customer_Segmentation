Data Preparation: Loads data and organizes it into a suitable format for analysis.

Feature Engineering: Combines numerical and categorical data into a unified representation for analysis.

Model Training: Utilizes K-means clustering to group similar data points into clusters based on their features.

Evaluation: Assesses the quality of the clustering model using the silhouette score to measure how well-defined the clusters are.

Visualization: Visualizes the clusters and their centroids on a scatter plot to understand the grouping of data points.
